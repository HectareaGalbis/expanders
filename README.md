## What is this\?

The project lets you define ``` expanders ```\. An ``` expander ``` is like a namespace for forms that should transform in a specific way\.

It easier to understand with an example\. Suppose we have the following form ``` (op (+ 3 4) b) ```\. This form will be used in two different macros named ``` plus-macro ``` and ``` minus-macro ```\. Each macro receives a form\. That form could start with ``` op ```\. In that case\, ``` op ``` is substituted by ``` + ``` or ``` - ``` respectively\.

Let\'s define 2 different expanders\:

`````common-lisp
;; We assume (use-package #:expanders)
(defexpander plus-expander)
(defexpander minus-expander)
`````
`````common-lisp
minus-expander
`````

Now we have two different expanders\. The function [exp\:expanderp](/README.md#function-expanders-expanderp) can tell us if a symbol denotes an expander\:

`````common-lisp
(expanderp 'plus-expander)
`````
`````common-lisp
t
`````

`````common-lisp
(expanderp 'hey)
`````
`````common-lisp
nil
`````

`````common-lisp
(expanderp 'minus-expander)
`````
`````common-lisp
t
`````

Now it is time to define the expansion ``` op ``` for each expander using [exp\:defexpansion](/README.md#function-expanders-defexpansion)\:

`````common-lisp
(defexpansion plus-expander op (a b)
  "OP to + expansion"
  `(+ ,a ,b))

(defexpansion minus-expander op (a b)
  "OP to - expansion"
  `(- ,a ,b))
`````
`````common-lisp
op
`````

We can check if a symbol is an expansion for a given expander using [exp\:expansionp](/README.md#function-expanders-expansionp)\:

`````common-lisp
(expansionp 'plus-expander 'op)
`````
`````common-lisp
t
`````

`````common-lisp
(expansionp 'plus-expander 'hey)
`````
`````common-lisp
nil
`````

`````common-lisp
(expansionp 'minus-expander 'op)
`````
`````common-lisp
t
`````

Also\, we can retrieve or set the docstring using ``` documentation ```\:

`````common-lisp
(documentation 'op 'plus-expander)
`````
`````common-lisp
"OP to + expansion"
`````

`````common-lisp
(let ((old-docstring (documentation 'op 'minus-expander)))
  (setf (documentation 'op 'minus-expander) "Another docstring")
  (let ((new-docstring (documentation 'op 'minus-expander)))
    (format t "Old: ~s~%New: ~s" old-docstring new-docstring)))
`````
`````text
Old: "OP to - expansion"
New: "Another docstring"
`````
`````common-lisp
nil
`````

We can expand a form using [exp\:expand](/README.md#function-expanders-expand)\. Note that the form must be a list starting with the name of an expansion\:

`````common-lisp
(expand 'plus-expander '(op 3 (+ 5 6)))
`````
`````common-lisp
(+ 3 (+ 5 6))
`````

`````common-lisp
(expand 'minus-expander '(op 3 (+ 5 6)))
`````
`````common-lisp
(- 3 (+ 5 6))
`````

Finally\, let\'s define the macros ``` plus-macro ``` and ``` minus-macro ```\:

`````common-lisp
(defmacro plus-macro (form)
  (if (and (consp form)
           (expansionp 'plus-expander (car form)))
      (expand 'plus-expander form)
      form))
`````
`````common-lisp
plus-macro
`````

`````common-lisp
(defmacro minus-macro (form)
  (if (and (consp form)
           (expansionp 'minus-expander (car form)))
      (expand 'minus-expander form)
      form))
`````
`````common-lisp
minus-macro
`````

If we use the form ``` (op 5 4) ``` we will see that each macro will expand to ``` (+ 5 4) ``` or ``` (- 5 4) ``` respectively\.

`````common-lisp
(plus-macro (op 5 4))
`````
`````common-lisp
9
`````

`````common-lisp
(minus-macro (op 5 4))
`````
`````common-lisp
1
`````

## Why\?

* **It is common**\: I have noticed that having expanders is a relatively common pattern in macros\. The best example is ``` setf ``` and its ``` setf-expanders ```\. Another project using expanders is [CFFI](https://github.com/cffi/cffi) and its type parsers\. In my own projects I ended up using the same techniques \([Clith](https://github.com/Hectarea1996/clith)\)\.
* **Duality of syntax**\: We can increase the duality of syntax using expanders\. The best example is ``` setf ```\. Thanks to ``` setf ``` we don\'t need names for setters because they come for free with the getter\.

## Reference

<a id="function-expanders-defexpander"></a>
#### Macro: exp:defexpander (sym)

`````text
Defines an expander represented by the symbol SYM.
`````

<a id="function-expanders-defexpansion"></a>
#### Macro: exp:defexpansion (expander name (&rest args) &body body)

`````text
Defines an expansion for the expander EXPANDER. NAME must be a symbol denoting
the new expansion. ARGS is a destructuring lambda list. This must return the desired
expansion for NAME and EXPANDER.
`````

<a id="function-expanders-expand"></a>
#### Function: exp:expand (expander form)

`````text
Expands a form using an expander. FORM must be a list starting with a valid
expansion symbol for the expander EXPANDER.
`````

<a id="function-expanders-expanderp"></a>
#### Function: exp:expanderp (sym)

`````text
Check if a symbol denotes an expander.
`````

<a id="function-expanders-expansionp"></a>
#### Function: exp:expansionp (expander expansion)

`````text
Checks if EXPANSION is a valid expansion for the expander EXPANDER.
EXPANDER must be a valid expander.
